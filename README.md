Unisync is a data synchronisation tool written in python and based on [unison](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison).  
The goal is to be able to keep data synchronised between multiple computers without needing to have all the data kept locally while at the same time being able to access everything.  

The development just started so the documentation will be written later.
